To set up PL/SQL on Linux Ubuntu, you'll need to install Oracle Database Express Edition (Oracle XE), which includes the Oracle SQL*Plus and PL/SQL components. Here are the general steps to set up PL/SQL on Linux Ubuntu:

## 1. Install Required Packages
- Oracle Database Express Edition requires some additional packages. Install them using the following commands:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install alien libaio1 unixodbc
  ```
## 2. Download or Install Oracle Database Express Edition (Oracle XE):
### A. Download
Go to the Oracle website and download the Oracle Database Express Edition for Linux. Make sure to accept the license agreement.
- [`Oracle Database Express Edition 21c Express Edition for Linux x64`](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/xe-downloads.html)
- Extract the downloaded file to a folder of your choice.
  ```bash
  unzip oracle-database-xe-*.rpm.zip
  ```
### B. Install
- Install the RPM package using the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo alien --scripts -d oracle-database-xe-*.rpm
  ```
- Install the Oracle Database Express Edition using the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo dpkg --install oracle-database-xe-*.deb
  ```
## 3. Configure Oracle Database Express Edition using the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo /etc/init.d/oracle-xe-21c configure
  ```
- The configuration script will prompt you to set a password for the SYS and SYSTEM users. Make sure to remember the password you set for these users.
- The configuration script will also prompt you to set the HTTP port for Oracle Application Express (APEX). The default port is 8080(or any other if already port is occupied).
## 4. Start the Oracle Database Express Edition using the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo service oracle-xe-21c start
  ```
## 5. Add the following lines to the end of the /etc/bash.bashrc file:
  ```bash
  export ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle/product/21c/dbhomeXE
  export ORACLE_SID=XE
  export PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/bin:$PATH
  ```
## 6. Load the new environment variables using the following command:
  ```bash
  source /etc/bash.bashrc
  ```
## 7. More Configuration
- Connect to the Oracle Database Express Edition using the following command:
  ```bash
  sqlplus sys as sysdba
  ```
- Enter the password you set for the SYS user when you configured the Oracle Database Express Edition.
- Run the following command to unlock the HR user:
  ```bash
  ALTER USER hr ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
  ```
- Run the following command to change the password for the HR user:
  ```bash
  ALTER USER hr IDENTIFIED BY hr;
  ```
- Connect to the Oracle Database Express Edition using the following command:
  ```bash
  sqlplus hr/hr
  ```
- Stop the Oracle Database Express Edition using the following command:
  ```bash
  sudo service oracle-xe-21c stop
  ```
- Run the following command to exit SQL*Plus:
  ```bash
  exit
  ```
