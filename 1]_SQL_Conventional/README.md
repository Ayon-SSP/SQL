### 24 Rules to the SQL Formatting Standard [Link](https://learnsql.com/blog/24-rules-sql-code-formatting-standard/)
- **Avoid** table/column in the plural ‚úÖ `employee` instead of ‚ùå`employees`
- **CamelCase style || using '_' || paka more than one word**: eg: employee_city, employee_name
- Check that the name is not already used as a keyword in SQL
- For the primary key column avoid the name id. A good idea is to combine id with the name of a table, for example: id_employee.
